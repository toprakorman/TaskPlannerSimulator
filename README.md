# TaskPlannerSimulator

TaskPlannerSimulator is the final project of the SE3317 - Software Design and Architecture class.

TaskPlanner is a simulation application that simulates the time while containing the tasks of the user. It is basically a test and a prototype of a task planner application.

The application is designed as a Desktop application with a Graphical User Interface and an IDE that communicates with the MySQL database. It is developed using the Java programming language and implemented using the Model-View-Controller architectural design pattern. In addition to this architecture, the application uses the observer, strategy, and composite software design patterns, as well as the Decorator pattern. The user interacts with only a single, clean interface.

This project was a group project and was done with my friend Ahmet Kemal Bilicier.
